# Module 8: Diagnostics and Monitoring

1. Wherever you see a path to file starting at **[Repository Root]**, replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides.
   e.g. - you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487**, then the following path: *[Repository Root]***\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01** will become **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01**.
2. Wherever you see **{YourInitials}**, replace it with your actual initials. For example, the initials for **John Doe** will be **jd**).

1. Open PerfView.
2. In the top menu bar, click **Collect** and then click on **Collect** again.
3. Click **Start Collection**.

#### Task 3: Run a script to invoke service and make it to throw exceptions

1. Open Powershell.
2. To change directory to the **Assets** folder, run the following command:
   ```bash
   cd [Repository Root]\AllFiles\Mod08\Labfiles\Lab1\Assets
   ```
3. To ensure TLS1.2 is used, enter the following command:
   ```pwsh
   [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
   ```
4.  To run the script that invokes the service 10 times, run the following command:
   ```bash
   .\requestsToServer
   ```
5. Close the command prompt.
6. Switch to **PerfView**.
7. Click **Stop Collection**, and then wait for the app to load the data.

#### Task 4: View exception details and call stacks in PerfView

1. Double-click **PerfViewData.etl.zip**.
2. Expand the **Advanced Group** folder, and then double-click **Exceptions Stacks**.
3. In the **Select Process window**, locate the following process:
   - In the **Name** column, find **dotnet**.
   - In the **CommandLine** column, find **dotnet exec** *[Repository Root]***\AllFiles\Mod08\Labfiles\Lab1\Blueyonder.Service**.
   - Double-click the process.
4. In the **Exception Stacks** window, click the **By Name** tab.
5. In the **Name** column, double-click **Throw(System.Exception) Id** *{number}* **can't be hash to flight code**.
6. View the exception call stack, find the line with the text **Blueyonder.Service.Controllers.FlightsControllers.Get(int32)**
7. This is the service that throw the exception.
8. On the top bar, in the **GroupPats** list, select **[no grouping]**.
9. Expand **Blueyonder.Service.Repository.FlightsRepository.HashFlightCode(int32)**.
10. View the exception call stack to see which method in the service throws the exception.
   > **Note**: The **HashFlightCode** method throws an exception and continues to **GetFlightCode**.

### Exercise 2: Collect and view LTTng events

#### Task 1: Run the ASP.NET Core application in a Linux container with COMPlus_EventLogEnabled=1

1. Open the command prompt.
2. To change directory to the **Blueyonder.Service** project, run the following command:
   ```bash
   cd [Repository Root]\AllFiles\Mod08\Labfiles\Lab1\Blueyonder.Service
   ```
3. To build the docker image, run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker build -t monitor .
   ```
4. To run the new container with the monitor image, run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name myapp monitor
   ```

#### Task 2: Record LTTng events with the Lttng CLI tool

1. To enter the shell in the container, run the following command:
   ```
   docker exec -it myapp bash
   ```
2. To update packages in the container, run the following command:
   ```bash

   ```
7. To create a new **LTTng** session, run the following command:
   ```bash
   lttng create sample-trace
   ```
8. To add context data (process id, thread id, process name) to each event, run the following commands:
   ```bash
   lttng add-context --userspace --type vpid
   lttng add-context --userspace --type vtid
   lttng add-context --userspace --type procname
   ```
